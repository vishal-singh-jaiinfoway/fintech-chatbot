        "question": "What if 2+ Gophers are requested",
        "answer": "When a request calls for 2 or more Gophers, the Gopher who accepts the request will receive the entire offer for the job once completed. It is the responsibility of the Gopher who accepts the request to ensure they have the additional help. The amount is not multiplied by the number of Gophers requested. If the amount of the offer is not enough to cover the crew needed in the opinion of the Gopher, it is recommended to not accept the request. It is very important to not accept a 2+ job if you cannot find the additional help. Accepting and then cancelling because the specified request criteria cannot be met may cause removal from the platform. "

        "category": "App Fees",
        "question": "How much does it cost to use the Gopher app",
        "answer": "Gopher Fees range from $0.99 to $4.99 depending on type of service requested, plus an Instant Transfer Fee of 8% of the total request offered. This fee covers the operating cost to ensure the Gopher is paid immediately upon completing your request. Age-Restrict Deliveries have an Extra $1.9 Fee. If you have your TrustShield ID verification, the Age-Restricted Fee is only $0.99. For example, if you made a request for a Delivery, wanting to pay a Gopher a total of $30, it would cost $33.47. (Cost of Goods = $20, Gopher Offer = $10, Gopher Fee = $0.99 and Instant Transfer Fee = $2.48) The Gopher would receive all $30 of your offer, costing you only $3.47 to use the app."

        "question": "Why do I have to pay for the items requested",

This amount, along with the offer, are paid out immediately after the request is completed. You are never required to accept a “purchase needed” request and can always just ignore them. Because the Gopher marketplace doesn’t have structures partnerships/contracts with venders, users avoid having to pay extreme mark-ups as a result. When it comes to certain items requested, there are not options to purchase in advance online or through an app, so the cost of goods option is how these are provided. All age restricted items requested cannot be delivered by a Gopher under 21 years old and cannot received by a user under 21 years old without providing legal government issued identification. "

        "category": "Payment",
        "question": "Why is there Cost Of Goods Amount",
        "answer": "Anytime there is a “Cost of Goods” amount listed in a request, that means the Requestor is paying you that amount, to pay on their behalf. For example, if you want a meal delivered from a Food Truck, and that Food Truck has no way for the Requestor to pay for the food in advance, they will enter the amount in the Cost of Goods section for you to pay on their behalf. Therefore you will have to pay for the items yourself initially (the money will already be in escrow and GUARANTEED to you immediately upon completion.) We understand this is different than most fulfilment apps, however this keeps costs for everyone involved way down. The Merchants, Requesters and Gophers all benefit this way. If you aren’t interested in these transactions or do not have the funds to cover the Cost of Goods, please DO NOT accept the request."

A Gopher will see exactly what is needed and where the price offer is normally listed, it will say, “Make Me An Offer“. If interested, they can accept the request and enter their cost for materials (if applicable) and how much they want to charge for the service. The bid will then be sent to the Requestor, where they can accept or decline the offer."

We continue to text reminders until it is confirmed OR 48 hours passes. In the case of the latter, the payout is automatically initiated. As a best practice, when in the presence of the requestor for a completed job, we encourage you to let them know they will be receiving a confirmation alert and to please confirm it as that is what initiates your payout."

Example of what not to do: “Need mulch spread in my backyard.” Example of what to do: “I need 12 yards of mulch laid in my backyard.

Anytime a request is submitted in a new area, we get to work on recruiting available Gophers in that area (please be patient with us as we’re just venturing outside of Raleigh, NC). 2) The offer may have been deemed too low for the Gophers in your area. Remember the offer to your Gopher is 100% of what they make for the job. They work for you, not Gopher, Inc. We encourage you to look at it this way, “I'm hiring you to do X for $Y.” On our end, if your offer is below the average accepted offer, you’ll see a pop-up and we’ll share what the average offer for that request category is. That said, you can still offer whatever amount you want."
